# @dopplerhq/universal-import-core

This package holds the core encryption logic that is used by the peer packages to securely import
secrets into Doppler. Instead of interacting with this package directly, you most likely want to
use one of the pre-built components for your app. You can find these by following one of the links
from the [parent README file](../).
